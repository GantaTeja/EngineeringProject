# Node to Node Path Highlighner of Route Map Using Arduinos and LED Stips

This is the README file for the "Node to Node Path Highlighner of Route Map Using Arduinos and LED Stips" project. This project contains embedded C code for [insert purpose or application of the project].

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your embedded system. Follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- software prerequisites, such as microcontroller, development board, compiler, IDE, etc.
- Arduino IDE

### Hardware Setup

1. Gather the required hardware components for your Arduino project, including the Arduino board, sensors, actuators, and any other peripherals.\

2. Connect the hardware components to the appropriate pins on the Arduino board, following the pinout diagram and pin assignments specified in your project documentation or code.

3. Make sure all connections are secure and properly seated, and any required power sources (e.g., batteries, power supplies) are connected as needed.

4. Double-check the hardware setup to ensure that it matches the requirements of your project and that there are no loose or incorrect connections.

### Software Setup

1. Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), following the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Launch the Arduino IDE and configure the IDE settings, such as selecting the correct Arduino board and port from the "Tools" menu.

3. Install any necessary libraries or dependencies required for your project. Libraries are pre-written code that provide additional functionality for your Arduino project, such as controlling specific sensors or actuators. You can install libraries using the Arduino Library Manager, which can be accessed from the "Sketch" > "Include Library" > "Manage Libraries" menu in the Arduino IDE.

4. Open or create a new Arduino sketch (.ino file) in the Arduino IDE, and write or paste your project code into the sketch.
Review and modify the code as necessary to match your hardware setup, pin assignments, and project requirements.

5. Save your Arduino sketch and click the "Verify" button in the Arduino IDE to compile your code and check for any errors.

6. If the code compiles without errors, you can proceed to upload it to your Arduino board by clicking the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE.

7. Once the code is uploaded, you can monitor the serial output, if applicable, for debugging or testing purposes using the "Serial Monitor" feature in the Arduino IDE.
